You may need to install GVIM in your system first.

After install, copy all the files in the directory `files` to the `$HOME` directory.

If you dont know what is the `$HOME` directory, open GVIM, type the command below:

    :ehco $HOME

It will output something like:

    C:\Users\srain\     // This is the $HOME
